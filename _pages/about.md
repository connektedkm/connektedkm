Welcome to my portfolio! As a brief introduction about me:

After a successful career as an IT Manager my recent work has taken on two forms. 

Both of which allow me to combine my technical knowledge with the breaking down of complex technical concepts and tools into a digestible format:

1. **Technical Writing** - Creating clear and concise procedural and conceptual documentation using Git, GitHub and Markdown.
2. **Online Course Creation** - understanding and implementing the concepts of pedagogy and instructional design to produce text and video content for IT engineers across the globe.

Check the individual links to read examples of both and get in touch using any of the contact details on the side.
